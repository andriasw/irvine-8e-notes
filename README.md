Reading, learning and coding based on Irvine's assembly language book (8e, Chinese Reprint: http://www.hzcourse.com/web/teachRes/detail/5181/208)

### About the Book

* I am in China, so I bought the Chinese reprint. If you are in China, please consider buying the reprint instead of using (or using only) pirated digital copies, one of the reasons being Pearson has stopped releasing PDFs with print layout ([related news report here](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-07-15/textbook-giant-pearson-makes-major-shift-away-from-print-to-digital)), and I would refer to locations in the Book using page numbers of the reprint, including [the errata list I keep](Errata.md).
* There is a Chinese translation of the eighth edition coming later this year, and according to what the publisher (HuaZhang Co. of China Machine Press) said in the 'recommended books' section at the end of the reprint, it would be available in the first half of the year. Despite that, I highly recommend buying the original English reprint rather than the translated version. Buying both is also recommended.
* No pirated copies of the Book will be uploaded here for copyright reasons.

### About myself

I am actually new to any kind of programming at all (tried C, Java, Python here and there but am actually at an elementary level), so if any technical or non-technical issues are found in this project, please do not hesitate and point it out using comments or anything git-related (no, I don't know git stuff either).

## Before you begin

I am not talking about technical prerequsites here. This repo serves mostly as a sidenote rather than a complete companion guide, which means that you should buy the Book before making use of this repo. And of course I am not trying to make this repo another tutorial on assembly language. Not for now at least.

Generally speaking, there are two types of materials available from [the author](http://asmirvine.com/). One is code source files and supporting library (`Irvine32` for instance), the other being [video lectures and tutorials called VideoNotes](https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ph/esm/ecs_irvine_x86_8/cw/#videonotes) on Pearson's website which are based on the seventh edition of the Book. I keep [a list](VideoNote%20to%20Sections.md) of the corresponding sections to these videos.

In terms of review questions, there were no choices in the seventh edition of the Book, but the eighth edition has. The interactive version of the Book even contains answers for most of these review questions. So here is [my compilation of the answers](Answers%20to%20Review%20Questions.md).
