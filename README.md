Reading, learning and coding based on Irvine's assembly language book (8e, Chinese Reprint: http://www.hzcourse.com/web/teachRes/detail/5181/208)

I am in China, so I bought the Chinese reprint. If you are in China, please consider buying the reprint instead of using (or using only) pirated digital copies, one of the reasons being Pearson has stopped releasing PDFs with print layout.

No pirated copies of the book will be uploaded here for copyight reasons.

I am actually new to any kind of programming at all (tried C, Java, Python here and there but am really at an elementary level), so if any technical or non-technical issues are found in this project, please do not hesitate and point it out using comments or anything git-related (no, I don't know git stuff either).
