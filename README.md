# irvine-8e-notes
Reading, learning and coding based on Irvine's assembly language book (8e, Chinese Reprint: http://www.hzcourse.com/web/teachRes/detail/5181/208)

I am in China, so I bought the Chinese reprint. If you are in China, please consider buying the reprint instead of using (or using only) pirated digital copies, one of the reasons being Pearson has stopped releasing PDFs with print layout.

No pirated copies of the book will be uploaded here for copyight reasons.

## Chapter 03

Sec. 3.2.2:
`AddTwo.asm` already included in the `Project32` folder, so no need to type again. Or one may just move all existing `.asm` files to another folder, and do step 3 in the beginning of the section.

And do unzip 20MB+ Irvine.zip and put it in C root directory, or a dependency error occurs when building the project.
